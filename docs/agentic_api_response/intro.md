# Agentic API Response Feature

## Overview

The Agentic API Response feature enables our travel assistant AI to intelligently trigger real-time searches for places, activities, restaurants, and venues during natural conversations with users. This enhancement transforms the chat experience from static advice to dynamic, actionable recommendations powered by live Foursquare API data.

## Problem Statement

Currently, our travel assistant can provide general advice and work with pre-existing trip data, but cannot:
- Search for new places when users ask "Find restaurants near the Louvre"
- Provide real-time recommendations based on current user queries
- Offer fresh alternatives when users want to explore beyond their planned itinerary
- Access live data about venues, ratings, and availability

## Solution Approach

We implement a **semi-transparent search system** using structured prompt engineering and string parsing. The AI model learns to recognize search intents and embed structured search commands within its natural language responses.

### Key Principles

1. **Natural Conversation Flow**: Users ask questions naturally without learning special commands
2. **Semi-Transparent Operations**: Users see when searches are happening and understand the process
3. **Actionable Results**: Every search result can be immediately added to trips or used to replace activities
4. **Context Awareness**: Searches leverage existing trip context (destination, preferences, itinerary)

## User Experience

**Before:**
```
User: "Find good restaurants near the Louvre"
AI: "I'd recommend looking for restaurants in the 1st arrondissement near the Louvre. French bistros and cafes are popular in that area."
```

**After:**
```
User: "Find good restaurants near the Louvre"
AI: "I'd be happy to help you find great restaurants near the Louvre!"
üîç Searching for restaurants...
AI: "I found 5 highly-rated restaurants near the Louvre:"
- Le Grand V√©four (4.8‚òÖ) - French cuisine at 17 Rue de Beaujolais
  [Add to Trip] [Replace Activity] [More Info]
- L'Ami Jean (4.6‚òÖ) - Bistro at 27 Rue Malar
  [Add to Trip] [Replace Activity] [More Info]
```

## Technical Benefits
