# Draft Trip Feature

## Overview

The Draft Trip feature provides users with a dedicated workspace to plan, experiment, and refine their travel itineraries before making them visible on their main dashboard. This enhancement allows for iterative trip planning without cluttering the primary trip interface with incomplete or experimental plans.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users face several challenges when planning trips:
- All trips immediately appear on the dashboard, even incomplete ones
- No way to experiment with different itinerary variations without creating multiple "real" trips
- Pressure to finalize trip details before exploring options
- Difficulty collaborating on trip ideas without committing to them publicly
- No clear distinction between active planning and finalized travel plans

## Solution Approach

We implement a **draft trip system** that creates a separate planning space for trip development. Users can create, modify, and experiment with trip ideas in draft mode before promoting them to active trips.

### Key Principles

1. **Separated Planning Space**: Draft trips exist in their own tab, keeping the main dashboard clean
2. **Iterative Development**: Users can freely modify, experiment, and refine without consequences
3. **Seamless Promotion**: Easy transition from draft to active trip when ready
4. **Complete Feature Parity**: Draft trips support all planning features available to regular trips
5. **Clear Status Indication**: Visual distinction between draft and active trip states

## User Experience

**Current Workflow:**
```
User creates trip → Immediately visible on dashboard → Pressure to complete quickly
```

**Enhanced Workflow:**
```
User creates draft trip → Experiments and refines in draft space → Promotes to active trip when ready
```

### Dashboard Enhancement
The dashboard will feature four tabs:
- **Upcoming**: Confirmed future trips
- **Current**: Active ongoing trips
- **Past**: Completed trip memories
- **Drafts**: Work-in-progress trip plans

### Trip Promotion Flow
In the trip details view:
- Draft trips display a "Make Active Trip" button
- Promotion converts draft status to active trip
- Trip moves from Drafts tab to appropriate status tab
- All trip data (activities, preferences, chat history) is preserved

## Technical Benefits

- **Minimal database changes** - Add draft status field to existing trip schema
- **Reuses existing components** - Draft trips use same UI as regular trips
- **Clean separation of concerns** - Draft logic contained in specific areas
- **Backwards compatible** - Existing trips remain unaffected
- **Simple state management** - Clear draft vs. active trip distinction

## Feature Scope

### Draft Trip Capabilities
